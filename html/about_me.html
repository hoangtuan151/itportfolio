I love running and football.
These sports help me gain more health to work as an IT guy from 2009 until now.
As a highly-motivated and results oriented guy, I could do stuff from the business information gathering to backend (Database, API) design/development & deployment on Docker/Cloud/Physical Server environments. 
On my career path, I alway try to find out how technologies could help people through building helpful products
and what I love most is discovering principles behind the way softwares were build.
